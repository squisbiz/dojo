			<p>
      According to Wikipedia, A dojo is a Japanese term which literally means "place of the way".
In the Western World, the term dojo primarily refers to a training place, usually meant for Japanese martial arts.<br><br>
      Inspired by this idea, and by the perfection-seeking performance of the martial artists, we have named this site The Dojo, a community-building online meeting place and training venue for software engineers to practice and hone their English-based communication and soft skills in a professional context. Just like a martial artists would do at a dojo.
